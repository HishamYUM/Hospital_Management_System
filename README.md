Our preject is comipled with javac 16.0.1, so in order to  run the .exe file you need JDK 16 
The project is not completed yet. We just implemented 3 GUIs. 
To test: choose log in as admin, then enter admin as user and admin as password, the connect. And the admin panel should appear. all other options and buttons aren't implemented yet.
Thanks!!!
